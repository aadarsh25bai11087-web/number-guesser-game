# Number Guessing Game

A simple Python game where the computer picks a random number and you try to guess it.

## About

This is a basic number guessing game I made for my Python course project. The game picks a number between 1 to 100 and you have to guess it. It will tell you if your guess is too high or too low.

## What You Need

- Python 3 installed on your computer
- Thats it!

## How to Run

1. Download the game.py file
2. Open command prompt or terminal
3. Go to the folder where you saved the file
4. Type: python game.py
5. Press Enter

## How to Play

The game will pick a random number. You type your guess and press enter. It tells you if you are too high or too low. Keep guessing until you get it right. The game shows how many tries you took.

After you win you can play again or quit.

## What I Learned

I used these Python concepts in this project:
- variables 
- if and else statements
- while loops
- taking input from user
- random module

## Files in Project
